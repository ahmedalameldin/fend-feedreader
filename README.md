# Project Overview

Project by Udacity Front-End Nanodegree course, a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

Our job is to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!

## How will this help my career?

- Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
- Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.

## How to run the web-based application

- [Download][download] required files as .zip extension.
- Unzip the file.
- Locate "index.html" and open it.

## Tests to complete this project

- Tests for allfeeds has been defined and that it is not empty
- Tests for allFeeds have a url and that the url is not empty
- Tests for allFeeds have a name and that the name is not empty
- Searches for the class of 'menu-hidden' in the body tag and checks that the menu is hidden
- Toggles on click event if the menu appears or disappears
- Tests if the loadFeed function has at least a single '.entry' within the '.feed' container
- Tests to see if two entries are not equal

### NOTES for Udacity Students

If you are one of Udacity students:

- Feel free to copy this project and use it, _BUT_ remember that the main **GOAL** is to learn how you can do projects by yourself.
- This is not the only or even best one, there are many ways to achieve the same result by diffrent piece of codes.
- Try to understand and you can find a better way for sure.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
